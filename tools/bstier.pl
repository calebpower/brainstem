# bstier.pl — HANDOFF.md's tier status table, checked against the suite.
#
# CONVENTIONS section 8 says which tiers the project REQUIRES and why. That is
# a slow-moving, normative claim and it is a person's to write. HANDOFF.md says
# which of them are BUILT, and that is fast-moving fact, so it is this tool's
# to write instead.
#
# The two were one table until they were not, and the failure is worth stating
# because it is the whole reason this file exists. Tier 6, differential fuzz,
# sat in the SIBLING project's tier table in the same voice as the tiers that
# ran. A reader seeing it beside a green suite concluded there was fuzz
# coverage; there was none, and there never had been. Brainstem starts with
# fourteen tiers declared and four built, so the hazard here is larger. A table that describes what you want and what
# you have in the same column will drift the moment those differ, and they
# differ almost always.
#
# Ported from the sibling, where the same table misled a reader in exactly
# this way. Brainstem is going to add tiers over six milestones; hand keeping
# a status table across that many is how it goes wrong.
#
# HOW A TIER IS FOUND. tests/run.sh carries "# TIER <ids>" markers. A marker
# claims every assertion after it, until the next marker, for each id it names.
# Ids may be numbers or numbers with a letter (9a). One marker may name several
# tiers where the suite genuinely interleaves them -- "# TIER 2 4" is honest,
# because a boundary vector and a golden vector sit in the same list and no
# machine can tell which is which.
#
# A grep pattern per tier was the alternative and was rejected: the pattern
# would live in the document rather than in the suite, so the suite could stop
# testing something and the document would go on matching a line that no longer
# ran. The marker lives where the assertions are.
#
# THREE STATES, because two were not enough:
#   yes     automated; at least one assertion under a marker naming it
#   manual  a practice rather than a check, so it has no marker and must not
#           have one; tier 11 (mutation) is the case
#   no      declared in CONVENTIONS and not built
#
# Usage:
#   bstier.pl             check; exit 1 if the table disagrees with the tree
#   bstier.pl --fix       rewrite the counts in HANDOFF.md
#   bstier.pl --selftest  prove it complains at each divergence
